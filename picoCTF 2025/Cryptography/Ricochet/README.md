# Ricochet

## Description
I bought this robot to help me locate flags, but the controller is stuck in a demo loop where the robot just goes in circles. Can you exploit the encryption between the controller to navigate the robot to the flag? Go to this web page for more instructions on how to interface with this challenge. All connections to the challenge will be made via the browser and/or HTTP requests to the server. You will need to use the functions provided in radio_interface.py to interface with the server. The source code for the robot and controller will be useful as well: robot.py; robotcontroller.py; crypto.py
